                    <p>The Jeffrey Miller story.  A native Clevelander - born, educated, and worked 
                        for 38 years developing a professional career in Information Technology.
                        I am a husband married for 36 years, farther of two sons and a daughter.  
                        A grandfarther of one grand daughter. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I would describe myself as a person with individuallistic style.  Not someone
                        who will follow the crowd - unless the crowd is correct.  I am project oriented
                        and enjoy participating in group work as a contributing team member.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I see my future as being involved in the visual representation and presentation
                        of data.  I would also like to augment my current systems knowledge and experience
                        with the ability to develop interactive applications accessible through the internet.
